Save them in data folder and set path to it in `DATA_PATH` environment.

Also, you can see Jupyter Notebooks `demo` - they have bash with `gdrive` implementation how download data.


## Docs

Go to the docs folder by `cd ./docs` and run (be sure you have node.js installed on your PC)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

In future plans if there will be some useful code and docs to deploy with Vercel or Netlify.

Now docs are almost empty.
